# Video-Chrome
  Video Chrome is a plugin for your videos that allows you to play/pause, mute/unmute, track the videos, and displays current   time and duration.

# Use it For Yourself
  add these tags to your HTML `<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">` and `<script src="chrome.js"></script>` 
  then in JS replace the video and thumb urls with your own
